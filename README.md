## 🚀 Overview
This repository demonstrates how to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the =nil; blockchain using Hardhat and our custom plugin. The =nil; blockchain is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution based on zk-sharding, enhancing transaction efficiency and scalability

## 🔧 Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil-hardhat-example.git
   cd nil-hardhat-example
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the given `.env.example` file
2. Update the `.env` file with the RPC URL. The default value corresponds to a locally running =nil; node
3. If you don't have `nil_cli` installed, you can download it from the official repository [here](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil_cli).
Once you have `nil_cli`, run the following commands to generate a new key and wallet:
    ```
    nil_cli keygen new
    nil_cli wallet new
    ```
4. Update the `.env` file with the private key and wallet address

## 🎯 Usage
To deploy and interact with the Incrementer contract, use the following commands:
```
# Deploy the contract
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Incrementer.ts --network nil

# Interact with the contract
npx hardhat increment --network nil --contract <Contract Address>
```

## 🎯 Testing
To run all tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm run tests
```
Make sure to configure `.env` with the RPC URL and PRIVATE_KEY
